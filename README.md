# Thesis project - Major Studio 2 

### Current "pain points"
- Is it better to articulate a forward-looking lens (i.e. "in what direction are we going in?") or put forward a data-driven narrative based on _historical_ records and/or current trends?
- Which geographical lens to pick? Which scale to use to produce this evidence? Need to decide how to handle all the various scales of impact (viticulture is both large and small scale..!).
- Level of geographical coverage of a given dataset - depending on data constraints, need to decide if I limit the spatial analysis to a specific region/set of wine-producing regions (the "Old World" for example)?

## Problem statement

I plan to examine the relationship between wine production patterns and climate change effects (current + expected) at a global level.One of the objectives would be to help the audience better understand which wine varieties (or wine-producing areas) are more likely to be resilient to climate shocks in the future.

## Outline (pending)



## Key questions & datasets ideas to probe/explore

1. Data on climate change trends & forecast
2. Data on wine production zones/export flows

1) GL-DAS reanalysis data
2) Wine regions dataset (global - to show where wine is grown). 
3) Dedicated over time grape stock in hectares and yield

* For the wine regions points, I could extract the average value for certain growth metrics from 1980 - 2020 (for example). 

## Target audience
- Industry-level practitioners involved in: 
1. Climate Change Adaptation/Climate-Smart Agriculture Policy (especially wine industry)
2. Parametric Insurance & Weather Forecasting
3. Land Administration & Cadaster (in rural zones)
4. Trade, Logistics & Supply Chain
- Wine Geeks as well as Food + Travel Enthusiasts

## UI design features (ideas)
1. Timeline slider to show long term patterns & geographical spread
2. Mapping forecast/trends to blend climate risks with vulnerable wine regions
3. Filter to contrast old world vs. new world (or expensive vs. affordable wines)

## Noteworthy spatial/temporal visuals (ideas)
