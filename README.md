# Thesis project - Major Studio 2 

Initial [Mindmap](https://app.mural.co/t/newschool14/m/newschool14/1643690438711/8729f87315827873d1ddd7c7095f14b6f8b6609e?sender=u6b4a2907c260aa3728a02010)

### *Current "pain points*"
- Is it better to articulate a forward-looking lens (i.e. "in what direction are we going in?") or put forward a data-driven narrative based on _historical_ records and/or current trends?
- Which geographical lens to pick? Which scale to use to produce this evidence? Need to decide how to handle all the various scales of impact (viticulture is both large and small scale..!).
- Level of geographical coverage of a given dataset - depending on data constraints, need to decide if I limit the spatial analysis to a specific region/set of wine-producing regions (the "Old World" for example)?

## Problem statement

I plan to examine the relationship between wine production patterns and climate change effects (current + expected) at a global level.One of the objectives would be to help the audience better understand which wine varieties (or wine-producing areas) are more likely to be resilient to climate shocks in the future.

Some questions I'm interested in exploring:
1. s
2. 2
3. 2

## Outline (pending)

#### Introduction
- Explain what's specific and interesting to the relationship between wine production & climate change (or global warming)
- Provide an overview of the analytical challenges with this topic and explain why I want to start explore this topic at a more macro level
- Provide an overview of the data sources and what the audience can expect to learn in terms of insights

#### Section 1 - Spatial overview #### (

#### Section 2 - Temporal dimension #### ("How climate change shifts harvest calendar and what are the implications for regions producing wine?")

#### Section 3 - 


## Key questions & datasets ideas to probe/explore (pending)

- Data on climate change trends & forecast
- Data on wine production zones/export flows

1) Check out GL-DAS reanalysis data
2) Locate wine regions dataset (global - to show where wine is grown). 
3) Analyze dedicated over time grape stock in hectares and yield

* For the wine regions points, I could try to extract the average value for certain growth metrics from 1980 - 2020 (for example)?

## Target audience
- Industry-level practitioners involved in: 
1. Climate Change Adaptation/Climate-Smart Agriculture Policy (especially wine industry)
2. Parametric Insurance & Weather Forecasting
3. Land Administration & Cadaster (in rural zones)
4. Trade, Logistics & Supply Chain
- Wine Geeks as well as Food + Travel Enthusiasts

## UI design features (ideas)
1. Timeline slider to show long term patterns & geographical spread
2. Mapping forecast/trends to blend climate risks with vulnerable wine regions
3. Filter to contrast old world vs. new world (or expensive vs. affordable wines)

## Noteworthy spatial/temporal visuals (ideas)
